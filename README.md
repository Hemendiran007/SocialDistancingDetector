# SocialDistancingDetector
This project is about designing a device that works by indicating a person when he/she is violating social distance between another person through alarming buzzer type sound . It mainly uses a Ultrasonic Distance sensor for sensing the close distance and piezo buzzer for alarm !!..

## Hi I am Hemendiran , designed and developed a new System that detects the violation of social distance , done this project on TinkerCad Circuits (Online). So first you have to create your account in Tinkercad circuits !!... Tinkercad circuits is a home for making a lot of Embedded systems projects online (virtually) :)

### I uploaded this whole project review as a Word document file , where you can get all the informations about my project on this system including source code!!
#### Coding language used : Arduino programming language
#### Platform used : TinkerCad Circuits (online)

#### You can know the circuit construction by seeing my Tinkercad project , i will provide this Tinkercad Project link along with the Code file
## THANK YOU :)
